				<h3>Lyrics</h3>
	    	<p>
			    	[Verse 1]
				    If I could begin to be
				    Half of what you think of me
				    I could do about anything
				    I could even learn how to love
				    When I see the way you act
				    Wondering when I'm coming back
				    I could do about anything
				    I could even learn how to love
				    Like you
		    <p>
				    [Verse 2]
				    I always thought I might be bad
				    Now I’m sure that it's true
				    ‘cause I think you’re so good
				    And I’m nothing like you
		    <p>
				    [Verse 3]
				    Look at you go
				    I just adore you
				    I wish that I knew
				    What makes you think I'm so special
		    <p>
			    [Verse 4]
			    If I could begin to do
			    Something that does right by you
			    I would do about anything
			    I would even learn how to love
